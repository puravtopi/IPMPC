    C2-C7 levels, on the left.   The Spurling test ispositive on left.  The cervical distraction test is positive on left.  ROM is as follows: Forward flexion is 30 degrees, normal is 50 degrees; Extension is 40 degrees, normal is 60 degrees; left Rotation is 45 degrees; left Lateral flexion is 66 degrees.  right Rotation is 66 degrees; right Lateral flexion is 66 degrees. There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at bilateral paraspinal,bilateral rhomboids,bilateral trapezius.        <br/><br/>Tender (+) interspinous region, at facets C-7 bilaterally.  Axial cervical facet loading positive bilaterally, neck pain worse on extension and lateral rotation of the cervical spine bilaterally.  Cervical Rigidity (+).  Muscle spasms (+).  Trigger points identified at bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles and Trapezius muscles -taut bands with discrete, hyperirritable, tender spots, with palpation induced muscle twitches and pain referred to shoulders<br/><br/>
<b><u>Thoracic Spine Examination</u>: </b> The thoracic spine exam reveals tenderness upon palpation at T1-T12 levels  with muscle spasm present.  ROM is mildly decreased.   There are palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as depicted below.     There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at bilateral paraspinal,bilateral rhomboids,bilateral trapezius,bilateral serratus posterior superior. <br/><br/>
<b>Lumbar Spine Examination: </b> The lumbar spine exam reveals tenderness upon palpation at  L1-S1 levelsbilaterally  with muscle spasm present.  The SLR test isnormal.  The FABER test ispositive on right.  The SI test ispositive on right.  <br/>ROM is as follows:  Forward flexion is 20 degrees, normal is 50 degrees; Extension is 15 degrees, normal is 60 degrees ; left Rotation is 15 degrees; left Lateral flexion is 36 degrees.  right Rotation is 63 degrees; right Lateral flexion is 36 degrees. There are palpable taut bands/trigger points at bilateral paraspinal.  Demo Lack Ram <br/><br/>Tender (+) moderately at facets at facets L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1 bilaterally, compared to interspinous region.

<br />

<b><u>FINAL DIAGNOSES</u>: </b><br/>Cervical radiculopathy<br/>Cervicalgia (Neck pain)<br/><br/>
<b><u>TREATMENT/PLAN:</u></b>
<br />
moist heat application,ice pack application,electric stimulation in low voltage,Treatment will begin ____ times a week for ____ weeks. The patient will be reevaluated in approximately ____ weeks, at which point in time I will assess the progress with physical therapy (and review the diagnostics that I have requested). It is my opinion the injuries sustained are causally related to the accident as described by the patient.<br/>
<br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Request cervical trigger point injections x3: </b>Because the patient presents with tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted on today's exam, and the patient has had conservative care with several  weeks of physical therapy along with anti-inflammatories, I  would like to request trigger point injections under ultrasound guidance those noted trigger points under ultrasound guidance on those noted trigger points.  This injection should decrease pain and inflammation and assist the therapist to obtain an increase in range of motion to expedite recovery.<br/><br/><br/><b style='text-transform:uppercase'>Schedule Lumbar (levels) Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection: </b>Due to ongoing pain despite conservative measures and based on symptoms, physical exam findings, and relevant diagnostic testing, the procedure is medically appropriate and necessary and hence scheduled.<br/><br/>
<b>Care: </b> Acupuncture, Chiropratic and  Demo.<br/><br/>
<b>Procedures: </b>If the patient continues to have tender palpable taut bands/trigger points with referral patterns as noted in the future on examination, I will consider doing trigger point injections. <br/><br/>
<b>Goals: </b>To increase range of motion, strength, flexibility, to decrease pain and to improve body biomechanics and activities of daily living and improve the functional status.<br/><br/>
<b>Precautions: </b>Universal, Cardiac and  Weight Bearing. Patient education provided via, physician , printed material, online website references.<br/><br/>
